# Data-Science-Portfolio

## About me:

I am a senior majoring in mathematics and concurrently attaining an MS in Data Science at CU Boulder, graduating from both programs in May 2023. In spring 2021 I took my first coding class, having never coded before. Since then, I have continued to learn more about machine learning, statistics, data mining, and data analysis. The projects in this portfolio are still a work in progress and I have left some of the older projects on my GitHub to show my personal development over the past 6 months. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me over email. My email is kyle.newman@colorado.edu. My next project will be for the 2023 NFL Big Data Bowl, creating metrics that NFL teams can utilize to measure performance for offensive and defensive linemen. In the spring, I will be taking a course called Statistical Collaboration, allowing me to work with on a team to solve a problem facing a client in a semester long data science project.

The data science industry is constantly evolving with ambiguity on the definitions of job roles such as data scientist, data analyst, ML Engineer, Applied Scientist, and business analyst. Many of the skills and requirements often overlap with other factors such as company size, years of excperience for role, and industry wildy affecting what the job entails.
#### Objective:
I want to optimize the jobs search process by taking into account what my personal preferences are and how they mirror specifc job postings while also building new skils along the way.
#### How: 
I created a mock business using DataBrick's 14-day free trial with a few different roles.
#### [Project Management Roadmap](https://github.com/kylenewm/Job-Search-Optimization/blob/main/Project_roadmap.png)
##### Data Scientist: 
###### 1. Utilized [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) library to clean job descriptions 
###### 2. Performed EDA and feature extraction to find most relevant information for each role 
###### 3. Used classifcation technqiues to find most important rquirements/skills for specific job roles
###### 4. Utilized clustering techniqued to create my own "customized" job search optmization
###### 5. Trained neural network to determine what roles would suit me best and automatically detect new roles that fits my preferences for future jobs

##### Data engineer: 
###### 1. Scraped 10000 job postings from indeed over a 10 day period 
###### 2. Uploaded data to Databricks
###### 3. Preprocessed data to allow for data analyst and data scientists to extract neccessary information 

##### Data Analyst
###### 1. Joined different tables with SQL and queried columns such as company, job title, industry, and location 
###### 2. Created dynamic dashboard with important metrics and key insights

#### Results:
