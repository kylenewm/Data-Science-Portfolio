# Data-Science-Portfolio

## About me:

I am a senior majoring in mathematics and concurrently attaining an MS in Data Science at CU Boulder, graduating from both programs in May 2023. In spring 2021 I took my first coding class, having never coded before. Since then, I have continued to learn more about machine learning, statistics, data mining, and data analysis. The projects in this portfolio are still a work in progress and I have left some of the older projects on my GitHub to show my personal development over the past 6 months. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me over email. My email is kyle.newman@colorado.edu.
