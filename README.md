### Job Search Optimization
#### Problem: The data science industry is constantly evolving with ambiguity on the definitions of job roles such as data scientist, data analyst, ML Engineer, Applied Scientist, and business analyst. Many of the skills and requirements often overlap with other factors such as company size, years of excperience for role, and industry wildy affecting what the job entails.
#### Objective: I want to optimize the jobs search process by taking into account what my personal preferences are and how they mirror specifc job postings while also building new skils along the way.
#### How: 
I created a mock business using DataBrick's 14-day free trial with a few different roles.

###### 1. Scraped 10000 job postings from indeed over a 10 day period

###### 3. Preprocessed data to allow for data analyst and data scientists to extract neccessary information 

##### Data Analyst
###### 1. Joined different tables with SQL and queried columns such as company, job title, industry, and location 
###### 2. Created dynamic dashboard with important metrics and key insights
